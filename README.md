# Intel 4004 Random Number Generator
This program for the Intel 4004 CPU generates and prints 16 bit random numbers using the Marsaglia or xorshift algorithm. The program was assembled with the [Macro Assembler AS](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/). The program was written to run on my [Intel 4004 Single Board Computer](https://github.com/jim11662418/4004-SBC). The 'putchar' function will undoubtedly need to be modified to run on your hardware or in your emulator.
